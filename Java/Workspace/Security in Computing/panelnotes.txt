CS: the science that deals with the theory and methods of 
processing information in digital computers, 
the design of computer hardware and software, and the 
applications of computers. 

IT: the development, implementation, and maintenance of 
computer hardware and software 
systems to organize and communicate information 
electronically. Abbreviation:  IT 

Computers are man-made tools that aid us in solving other problems. 
A biologist is trying to figure out how life works, physicists and 
chemists are trying to figure out how items react in our universe, 
mathematicians are trying to figure out rules for man-made systems.

Any research problem that may improve a computer’s capability of 
helping solve a problem or any research problem that sheds light 
about a new way to do something with a computer is part of CS.

Most exciting research: Medical Applications (Expert Systems for Diagnosis, 
Remote surgery, nano-devices with computing power to deliver medicine, etc.), 
We need help trying to create a comprehensive EMR accessible to the right people only, 
Cars that can drive themselves – seems like the best way we know how to solve lots of 
problems is by throwing lots of computing power at them, instead of looking for 
elegant solutions. This doesn’t sound exciting, but it will be exciting when the 
results are achieved. (ie Watson)

CS students tend to find jobs where they program at least some. 
In the process, they are solving problems.

Challenges: It’s impossible to teach all the new languages/toys. 
Ultimately, we just need to teach our students how to think, so 
that they can pick up new things on their own. 
Our biggest challenge is getting them to buy into that.

Ethical: Lots, with security etc.
